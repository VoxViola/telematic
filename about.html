                <p>Telematic Collisions is a hybrid performance and installation series that reimagines how we gather and create together across distance, discipline, and medium. Designed to unfold simultaneously in multiple locations or virtually, each event connects artists, musicians, technologists, and audiences in real time through a blend of networked performance, interactive visuals, and sound.</p>
                <p><br> Whether in person, remote, or both, Telematic Collisions invites participation and co-creation, transforming physical separation into artistic opportunity. By collapsing geographic boundaries, it becomes a space for shared experimentation where gesture, movement, and music meet technology in unexpected and dynamic ways.</p>
                <p><br> This is not just a show, itâ€™s an invitation to collide, connect, and create. </p>
